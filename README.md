This project is an app that adds contacts for a user. The contact includes the first name, last name, twitter handle, and some notes about the contact. The app has read, update, delete, create (CRUD) functionality, although it only uses data in memory and not a database to store information.

The app uses the following technologies:

- Plain css for styling - React + Vite
- React Router for pages and routing
- In data memory libraries
